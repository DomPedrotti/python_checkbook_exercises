# python_checkbook_exercises
Hello!

Thanks for checking out my first real python project!

The purpose of this project was to create a personal checkbook application that tracks account credits and debits for a particular person. You can see the full project prompt at python_checkbook_project_prompt.txt

I had a lot of fun with the project and wanted to make my version do more than what was required.

Using SQLite library, I was able to make functions that create unique tables for every new user that logs onto my script, and I created one junction table that contains every username and password for the users. 

once loged in, users can choose to view their balance, make a transaction, or view history. With SQL commands I've added options to filter the results you get from history by date, keywords, and by transaction type

I haven't taken any real securty measures, so make sure that you don't use any real credentials when using the project. 

The best way to see how it works is to just test it out and see what it does!

If you can manage to break the application, please let me know what you did and what error message you received! I'm still in the debugging process.
